### Highlights
**Lab_01:**
In this lab I implemented my knowledge of algorithms and functions to draw a variety of shapes using the turtle module in Python. I utilized many additional features of this module such as pen size, fill color, and turtle movement. 

**Lab_02:**
In this lab I implemented my knowledge of while loops and if-statements to demonstrate my basic understanding of animation and frames within Pygame.

**Lab_03:**
In this lab I implemented my knowledge of loops and if-statements to demonstrate a more advanced understanding of animation within Pygame. I incorporated many additional features, including edge-detection, random spawning, and color and size manipulation within my program. 

**Lab_04:**
In this lab I implemented my knowledge of functions to demonstrate my understanding of collisions within Pygame. 

**Lab_05:**
In this lab I implemented my knowledge of functions, lists, tuples, and for loops to improve and expand the previously written Pygame program from Lab 3.

**Lab05_Collisions.py:**
I took Lab 5 a step further by not only having the balls bounce off of the edges of the screen, but also bounce off of each other by using my previous knowledge of collisions from Lab 4.

**Lab_06:**
In this lab I implemented my knowledge of user input, functions, game loops, and image display to create a complete and interactive game.

**Lab_07:**
In this lab I implemented my knowledge of functions and dictionaries to solve several code breaking riddles. I programmed several functions to decipher a given message.

**Lab_08:**
In this lab I implemented my knowledge of sprites, functions, and user input to fully animate a walking character. I also used my knowledge from Lab 6 to change the background. 

**Guessing Games:**
These files contain scripts that demonstrate my understanding of while loops and if-statements to create a number of guessing game program. I incorporated features such as the random module within Python and warmer and colder hints; I attempted to implement the binary search method to improve my programs. 

**Function Work:**
All of these files mainly contain additional programs relating to functions that were either discussed in class, or that were assigned as practice work for the midterm and final exam.

**Exam Work:**
All of these files contain programs that were written for the midterm and final exam prompts.
